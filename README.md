# My Personal Project

## Messaging Platform 

**What will the application do?**
* The application will allow a user to create or log into the platform and
chat with others. This application will be entirely offline however users 
may still be able to chat with others through sockets. As the conversation
or message is sent it will log the chats for them to appear when reopened.

**Who will use it?**
* In an actual social media platform anyone would be able to use it to 
connect with friends and family. However, since this is a mock social media
platform the messages are limited to people who have the copy of the code 
present in person or people can have their own version of it with their own
conversations which are limited to that persons device that has the code.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**
* On a daily basis, I interact with others countless times each day
through an online social media app. I want to somewhat understand 
the programming aspects behind it which is what intrigues me.

### User Stories
* As a user, I want to be able to create an account which I can use to talk to others
* As a user, I want to be able to create a new conversation with other users
* As a user, I want to be able to view a list of people I have talked to
* As a user, I want to be able to receive messages that others may have sent to me
* As a user, I want to be able to view a list of accounts to talk to
* As a user, I want to be able to save messages I have viewed (or else they get deleted)
* As a user, I want to be able to load messages from file

### Instructions for Grader
* To Create an Account enter a username and a password that is at least 8 characters long and click create account
* To log in enter the username and password for a registered account and then click log in
* To send a message select a user to send a message to and send as many messages as you want and click
back to go to the options page when you are finished
* To load or update the information the program has click on the load button
* To see you messages click on a user that has sent you a message and click back if you do not wish to save and save 
if you wish to keep your message

### Example of EventLog
* Fri Dec 01 04:28:27 PST 2023
* Added Account
* Fri Dec 01 04:28:34 PST 2023
* Logged in
* Fri Dec 01 04:28:34 PST 2023
* Added Message

### Phase 4: Task 3
* If I had more time to work on the project, I would probably spend more time on the readability
of my SwingUI code because it is quite clustered and very messy. Due to the 25 line constraint I
had declared a lot of unnecessary global variables. A change I would make is that I would use
suppress the warning for the 25 line limit. I would also take into consideration about more of 
the code and seeing if there was any code that I could have reused and just created one method rather
than writing the code for it another time. I had done this with the back button but I think I could
have done it in some other places too.
