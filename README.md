# My Personal Project

## Mock Social Media Platform 

**What will the application do?**
* The application will allow a user to create or log into the platform and
chat with others. This application will be entirely offline however users 
may still be able to chat with others through sockets. As the conversation
or message is sent it will log the chats for them to appear when reopened.

**Who will use it?**
* In an actual social media platform anyone would be able to use it to 
connect with friends and family. However, since this is a mock social media
platform the messages are limited to people who have the copy of the code 
present in person or people can have their own version of it with their own
conversations which are limited to that persons device that has the code.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**
* On a daily basis, I interact with others countless times each day
through an online social media app. I want to somewhat understand 
the programming aspects behind it which is what intrigues me.

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to create a new conversation with other users
* As a user, I want to be able to view a list of people I have talked to

* As a user, I want to be able to view a list of accounts to talk to
